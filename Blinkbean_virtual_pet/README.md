# 🐾 Blinkbean – A Soft & Sassy Digital Pet (JavaScript Project)

Welcome to the softest corner of my brain ☁️✨  
This is my **very first JavaScript project** — a cozy little fantasy creature named **Blinkbean** who's emotional, adorable, and reacts to how much love (or neglect 😭) you show her.

- 🎨 Designed and animated by me using **Canva**
- 🧠 All logic done in **Vanilla JavaScript** — no libraries!
